# Big_Mart_Sales Analysis

The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.Using this model,We will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

## Objectives in this project:
- Perform data cleaning on the dataset
- Make a EDA report 
- Visualize the distributions of various features and correlations between them
- Feature engineering to extract the correct features for the model
- Build a regression model to predict the outlet sales

The project is done as a mandatory Final Project under the Machine Learning Course at Acadview under the guindance of Mr. Shreyas Raghavan(https://github.com/Shreyas3108) and Ms. Meghna P Ayyar(https://github.com/leomi7)
